## About Me
I’m an aspiring quantitative analyst with a background in computer science and accounting. I focus on developing algorithmic trading strategies, building machine learning models, and applying data analysis to financial markets. I primarily work in *Python* and *C++*, using libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib. My repositories include both coursework projects, which demonstrate my coding skills and project organization, and independent projects focused on algorithmic trading and financial data analysis. I’m enthusiastic about quantitative finance and continually expanding my skills in this area.
